An Introduction to the Scheme->C C Declaration Compiler
-------------------------------------------------------

The C declaration compiler is a tool for generating stub procedures to access
C structures and library functions.  It was designed to allow Scheme->C to
access the X11 Xlib.  This document is intended to be an introduction to the
language.  For complete understanding of its use,  the reader should examine
the Xlib declaration files and the declaration compiler.

The declaration compiler is invoked by:

 	cdecl  class  command  cdecl-files...

where "class" is the name of the set of declarations and "command" is
one of the following:

 	-const			Emits constant definitions to the files
				classCONSTANTS.sc and classCONSTANTS.sch.

	-extern			Emits external procedures for each cdecl-file
				containing extern definitions to files named
				<cdecl-file-root>.sc and <cdecl-file-root>.sch.

	-typedef		Emits type definitions for structures to the
				files <type-name>.sc and <type-name>.sch.
				Emits all type checking functions and type
				definitions for objects other than structs or
				unions to classTYPES.sc and classTYPES.sch.

The command is then followed by one or more files containing declarations.
The declaration files normally have the file extension ".cdecl".

Declaration Language
--------------------

The declaration files contain size, constant, type, and external procedure
definitions.  The sizes of the basic C types are defined by expressions of the
form:

	(sizeof <type> <char size> <char alignment> <to-ref> <to-set!>)

The program "sizeof" produces the architecture dependent size declarations for
a system.  For example, on a DECstation 5000, the declarations are:

	(sizeof char 1 1 c-byte-ref c-byte-set!)
	(sizeof shortint 2 2 c-shortint-ref c-shortint-set!)
	(sizeof shortunsigned 2 2 c-shortunsigned-ref c-shortunsigned-set!)
	(sizeof int 4 4 c-int-ref c-int-set!)
	(sizeof unsigned 4 4 c-unsigned-ref c-unsigned-set!)
	(sizeof longint 4 4 c-longint-ref c-longint-set!)
	(sizeof longunsigned 4 4 c-longunsigned-ref c-longunsigned-set!)
	(sizeof float 4 4 c-float-ref c-float-set!)
	(sizeof double 8 8 c-double-ref c-double-set!)
	(sizeof pointer 4 4 c-unsigned-ref c-unsigned-set!)
	(sizeof procedure 4 4 c-unsigned-ref c-unsigned-set!)

These declarations should always be in the first declaration file to cdecl.

A constant is defined by expressions of the form:

	(const <identifier> <expression>)

where the expression is evaluated at compile time and is defined as the
following:

	<expression> ::= <constant-symbol>
		         Scheme-constant
		         ( Scheme-procedure [ <expression> ... ] )

Types are defined by expressions of the following form:

	(typedef <type> <identifier>)

where:

	<type> ::= (<stype> *)
		   (<stype> *proc)
		   <stype>

	<atype> ::= (<stype> integer)
		    <struct-or-union-specifier>

	<stype> ::= char
		    shortint
		    shortunsigned
		    int
		    unsigned
		    long
		    longunsigned
		    float
		    double
		    <type-def-name>

	<type-def-name> ::= <identifier> denoting another type

	<struct-or-union-specifier> ::=	( struct [<struct-decl> ...] )
					( union  [<struct-decl> ...] )

	<struct-decl> ::= ( <atype> <identifier> )

The final form of expression is used to define external procedures:

	( EXTERN <type> <fname> [ <arg> ... ] )

where:

	<fname>  ::= a Scheme string

	<arg>	 ::= ( <type> <id> )
		     ( IN <type> <id> )
		     ( OUT <type> <id> )
		     ( IN_OUT <type> <id> )

	<id>	 ::= a Scheme symbol

Since the declaration source file is a file of Scheme expressions, it is case
insensative and it may contain Scheme comments.

An Example
----------

The use of the declaration language is best shown by example.  A few C
declarations from X11's Xlib are:

	#define DoRed   (1<<0)
	#define DoGreen (1<<1)
	#define DoBlue  (1<<2)

	typedef struct {
		unsigned long pixel;
		unsigned short red, green, blue;
		char flags;
		char pad;
	} XColor;

	typedef struct _XDisplay{
		.
		.
		.
	} Display;

	typedef int Status;
	typedef unsignedlong XID;
	typedef XID Colormap;
	
	extern Status XLookupColor();

Converted to the declaration language, they become:

	(const dored 1)
	(const dogreen 2)
	(const doblue 4)

	(typedef (struct
        	(unsigned pixel)
        	(shortunsigned red)
        	(shortunsigned green)
        	(shortunsigned blue)
        	(char flags)
        	(char pad)
	) xcolor)
	(typedef (xcolor *) xcolorp)
	(typedef (xcolor 0) xcolora)
	(typedef (xcolora *) xcolorap)

	(typedef (struct) display)
	(typedef (display *) displayp)

	(typedef int status)
	(typedef unsigned xid)
	(typedef xid colormap)

	(extern status "XLookupColor"
		(displayp dpy)
		(colormap cmap)
		(string spec)
		(out xcolor def) (out xcolor scr))

The constants are converted in a straight-forward manner, only noting that case
does not count in Scheme.  When the struct XColor is converted, declaration
lists must be broken up into multiple statements.  In addition, types are
added to define a pointer to an XColor struct, xcolorp, an array of
indeterminate size of the XColor structs, xcolora, and a pointer to such an
array, xcolorap.  The struct, Display, is defined an an "opaque" type, display,
with a pointer to one defined as displayp.  Unlike C, procedure interfaces have
the type of each argument specified.  Since Scheme has automatic storage
management, functions may return new instances of structured objects.  This is
noted in the declarations, where def and scr are noted as "out" arguments.

The reader should now consult the Scheme->C Xlib documentation for the Scheme
programmer's view of the resulting interface.
