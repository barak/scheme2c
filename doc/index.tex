\section*{Implementation Notes}

\StoC\ is an implementation of the language Scheme as
described in the \emph{Revised$^4$ Report on the Algorithmic Language
Scheme} (\emph{LISP Pointers}, Volume IV, Number 3, July-September 1991).

The implementation is known to not conform to the required portions of
the report in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The syntax for numbers reflects the underlying C implementation.
Scheme programs may not use the numeric prefixes \texttt{\#i}
and \texttt{\#e}, and numbers may not contain \texttt{\#} as a digit.

\item
Numerical input and output uses the facilities of the
underlying C implementation.  As a result, the constraints of
section 6.5.6 may not be satisfied.

\item
As /, quotient, and remainder depend upon C's behavior for
negative fixed arguments (which is undefined), those doing ports
must verify their correct operation.

\item
Implementations that do not handle arithmetic overflow traps
may return incorrect results when an overflow occurred during
the operation.

\item
The control flow of compiled programs is constrained by the
underlying C implementation.  As a result, some tail calls are not compiled as
tail calls.
\end{itemize}

The implementation has been extended beyond the report in the
following ways:

(\texttt{\%record-lookup-method} \emph{record} \emph{method}) returns
either the \emph{record}'s method \emph{procedure} or \texttt{\#f}
when no method is defined for the method named \emph{method}.  All
records have defaults for the following methods:
\texttt{\%to-display}, \texttt{to-equal?}, \texttt{\%to-eval}, and
\texttt{\%to-write}.

(\texttt{\%record-methods} \emph{record}) returns a list of
\emph{pairs} that denote the methods for \emph{record}.  Each
\emph{pair} is composed of a \emph{symbol} denoting the method name
and the method \emph{procedure}.

the methods associated with \emph{record} to \emph{methods}, a
\emph{list} of method \emph{pairs}.

\texttt{\%record-prefix-char} is the character that denotes a
\emph{record}.

\texttt{\%record-read} is a \emph{procedure} that is called to read a
\emph{record}. When \texttt{read} encounters the value of
\texttt{\%read-prefix-char} following a \texttt{\#}, it calls
\texttt{\%record-read} with the current \emph{input-port} as its
argument to input the record.  The value read is the value returned by

number of levels to print (or \texttt{\#f}), the length of lists,
vectors, or records to print (or \texttt{\#f}), and a list of pairs,
vectors, and records already seen (or \texttt{\#f}).  The method
returns either \texttt{\#f} indicating no further action is to be
taken, or a pair indicating that the car of the pair is to be output.
For example, if \texttt{\%record-prefix-char} is
\texttt{\#\textbackslash\texttildelow}, the method could be:
\texttt{(lambda (r port .\ ignore) (display "\#\texttildelow" port)
  (list (\%record->list r)))}.

\emph{record} and the comparison value as its arguments.  The default
method is \texttt{eq?}.

\texttt{\%to-eval} method to evaluate a \emph{record}.  \texttt{Eval}
evaluates a \emph{record} by returning the value of calling the
\emph{record}'s \texttt{\%to-eval} method with the \emph{record} as
the argument.  The default method is \texttt{(lambda (x) x)}.

\texttt{\%to-write} method to \texttt{write} a \emph{record}.  When
\texttt{write} encounters a record, it calls the record's
\texttt{\%to-write} method with the following arguments: the record,
the output port, the number of spaces to indent (or \texttt{\#f}), the
number of levels to print (or \texttt{\#f}), the length of lists,
vectors, or records to print (or \texttt{\#f}), and a list of pairs,
vectors, and records already seen (or \texttt{\#f}).  The method
returns either \texttt{\#f} indicating no further action is to be
taken, or a pair indicating that the car of the pair is to be output.
For example, if \texttt{\%record-prefix-char} is
\texttt{\#\textbackslash\texttildelow}, the method could be:
\texttt{(lambda (r port .\ ignore) (display "\#\texttildelow" port)
  (list (\%record->list r)))}.

\texttt{'}\emph{expression} abbreviation for (\texttt{quote}
\emph{expression}).  \RRRRRS~7, 16.

(\texttt{*} \emph{number} ...)\ returns the product of its arguments.
\RRRRRS~21.

arguments, this returns the difference of its arguments, associating
to the left.  With one argument it returns the additive inverse of the
argument.  \RRRRRS~21.

\texttt{-C} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} that will cause the
compiler to compile the Scheme files \emph{source}\texttt{.sc} to C
source in \emph{source}\texttt{.c}.  No further processing is
performed.

\texttt{-I} \emph{directory} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} to
supply a directory to be searched by \texttt{include} when it is
looking for a source file.  When multiple flags are supplied, the
directories are searched in the order that the flags are specified.

\texttt{-LIBDIR} \emph{directory} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} to
supply the \emph{directory} containing the files: predef.sc,
objects.h, libs2c.a, and optionally libs2c\_p.a.

\texttt{-Ob} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} that controls bounds
checking.  When it is supplied to the compiler, no bounds checking
code for \emph{vector} or \emph{string} accesses will be generated.
Supplying this flag is equivalent to supplying the flags \texttt{-f
  '*bounds-check*' '\#f'}.

\texttt{-Og} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} that controls the
generation of stack-trace debugging code. When it is supplied to the
compiler, stack-trace code will not be generated.

\texttt{-On} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} that controls number
representation. When it is supplied to the compiler, all numbers will
be assumed to be \emph{fixed} integers.  Supplying this flag is
equivalent to supplying the flags \texttt{-f '*fixed-only*' '\#t'}.

\texttt{-Ot} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} that controls type
error checking. When it is supplied, no error checking code will be
generated. Supplying this flag is equivalent to supplying the flags
\texttt{-f '*type-check*' '\#f'}.

\texttt{-e} command line flag to \texttt{s2ci}.  When it is supplied,
all text read on the standard input file will be echoed on the
standard output file.

\texttt{-emacs} command line flag to \texttt{s2ci}.  When supplied, the
interpreter assumes that it is being run by GNU emacs.

\texttt{-i} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} that will combine the
source and object files into a Scheme interpreter.  Module names for
files other than Scheme source files must be supplied using the
\texttt{-m} command line flag.

\texttt{-log} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} to log information
internal to the compiler.  Each type of compiler information is
denoted by one of the flags: \texttt{-source}, \texttt{-macro},
\texttt{-expand}, \texttt{-closed}, \texttt{-transform},
\texttt{-lambda}, \texttt{-tree}, \texttt{-lap}, \texttt{-peep}.  The
flag \texttt{-log} is equivalent to specifying the flags:
\texttt{-source}, \texttt{-macro}, \texttt{-expand}, \texttt{-closed},
\texttt{-transform}, \texttt{-lambda}, and \texttt{-tree}.

\texttt{-m} \emph{module} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} to specify
the name of a module that must be initialized by calling the procedure
\emph{module\_\_init}.  Note that the Scheme compiler will downshift
the alphabetic characters in module names supplied in the
\texttt{module} directive.  Modules are initialized in the order that
the \texttt{-m} command flags are specified.

\texttt{-nh} command line flag to \texttt{s2ci}.  When it is supplied,
the interpreter version header will not be printed on the standard
output file.

\texttt{-np} command line flag to \texttt{s2ci}.  When it is supplied,
prompts for input from standard input will not be printed on standard
output.

\texttt{-q} command line flag to \texttt{s2ci}.  When it is supplied,
the result of each expression evaluation will not be printed on
standard output.

\texttt{-pg} command line flag to \texttt{s2cc} that will cause it to
produce profiled code for run-time measurement using \emph{gprof}.
The profiled library will be used in lieu of the standard Scheme
library.

\texttt{-scgc} \emph{flag} command line flag to any Scheme program
that controls the reporting of garbage collection statistics.  If
\emph{flag} is set to 1, then garbage collection statistics will be
printed on stderr.  This flag will override \texttt{SCGCINFO}.

\texttt{-sch} \emph{integer} command line flag to any Scheme program
to set the initial heap size in megabytes.  If it is not supplied, and
the \texttt{SCHEAP} environment variable was not set, and the program
did not have a default, then the implementation dependent default is
used.  This flag will override \texttt{SCHEAP}.

\texttt{-scl} \emph{integer} command line flag to any Scheme program
to set the full collection limit.  When more than this percent of the
heap is allocated following a generational garbage collection, then a
full garbage collection will be done.  The default value is 40.  This
flag will override \texttt{SCLIMIT}.

\texttt{-scm} \emph{symbol} command line flag to any Scheme program to
cause execution to start at the procedure that is the value of
\emph{symbol}, rather than at the main program.  Note that the Scheme
\texttt{read} procedure typically upshifts alphabetic characters.
Thus, to start execution in the Scheme interpreter, one would enter
\texttt{-scm READ-EVAL-PRINT} on the command line.

\texttt{-scmh} \emph{integer} command line flag to any Scheme program
to set the maximum heap size in megabytes.  If it is not supplied, and
the \texttt{SCMAXHEAP} environment variable was not set, then the
maximum heap size is five times the initial heap size. This flag will
override \texttt{SCMAXHEAP}.

\emph{symbols} in the module will be made top-level. The final clause,
(\texttt{with} \emph{symbol} ...)\ indicates that this module will be
linked with other modules.  Normally the intermodule linkages are
automatically infered by including all \emph{modules} that have
external references. However, this mechanism is not sufficient to pick
up those objects that are only referenced at runtime.
