/* Attributes of the selected architecture:

   The following four macros define specific aspects of the system.  They
   are defined as strings, or specifically undefined:

	IMPLEMENTATION_MACHINE	machine type
	IMPLEMENTATION_CPU	cpu type
	IMPLEMENTATION_OS	operating system
	IMPLEMENTATION_FS	file system

   Big endian vs. little endian:

	BIGENDIAN		defined to 1 to denote bigendian systems

   C compiler:

	OLD_FASHIONED_C		defined to 1 for pre-ANSI compilers

   Alignment:

	DOUBLE_ALIGN		defined to 1 to force doubles to be aligned on
				an even S2CINT boundary

   Macro expansion:

	NEED_MACRO_ARGS		defined to 1 to declare a macro like X() as
				X(dummy)

   The types S2CINT and S2CUINT are defined to be signed and unsigned integers
   that are the same size as pointers.  This is the basic "word" used by
   Scheme->C.

   The machine state when a continuation is created is captured in the
   sc_jmp_buf data structure.

   STACKPTR( x ) is a define that stores the address of the stack pointer
   in x.

   Unix flavors:

	POSIX			POSIX.1 compliant
	SYSV			System V or derivative
	SYSV4			System V release 4 (also define SYSV, POSIX)
