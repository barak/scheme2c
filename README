This is the root directory for the Scheme-to-C compiler which was done at
Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Laboratory.

Changes from the previous release are noted in the file CHANGES found in this
directory.

The compiler distribution consists of several directories:

	doc		contains documentation.

	ports		contains implementation specific files.	

	scrt		contains the runtime system.

	scsc		contains the compiler.

	test		contains compiler and runtime test programs.

	cdecl		a C declaration compiler written in Scheme.

	xlib		X11 Xlib stubs for Scheme->C.

In order to install the compiler and interpreter on a system, the following
steps must be done.  These instructions assume you're working on a
workstation with a "unix-like" operating system such as a DECstation 5000
running ULTRIX.


1.  Verify that this directory contains the previously mentioned directories.

2.  Create directories for the processor(s) desired:

	For Alpha AXP OSF/1:

		1 > make forAOSF

	For Apple Macintosh system 7.1 with Think-C 5.0:

		1 > make forMAC

	For ULTRIX DECstations:

		1 > make forDECMIPS

	For SGI systems based on Rx000 MIPS processors:

		1 > make forSGIMIPS

	For ULTRIX VAX systems:

		1 > make forVAX

	For Microsoft Windows 3.1 with Microsoft C 7.0:
	 
		1 > make forWIN16

3.  Build Scheme->C for a specific processor:

	For Alpha AXP OSF/1:

		2 > cd AOSF;make port

	N.B.: During the compilation, uopt warnings of the form "this procedure
	not optimized because it exceeds size threshold" may occur.  These
	warnings may be ignored.


	For Apple Macintosh system 7.1 with Think-C 5.0:

		No further steps are done on the workstation.  Follow the
		instructions in MAC/README to transfer files to a Macintosh
		and complete the build.


	For ULTRIX DECstations:

		2 > cd DECMIPS;make port

	N.B.: During the compilation, uopt warnings of the form "this procedure
	not optimized because it exceeds size threshold" may occur.  These
	warnings may be ignored.


	For SGI systems:

		2 > cd SGIMIPS;make port

	N.B.: During the compilation, uopt warnings of the form "this procedure
	not optimized because it exceeds size threshold" may occur.  These
	warnings may be ignored.


	For VAX systems:

		2 > cd VAX;make port

	N.B.:  During the compilation of scrt/scinit.c, one will get the
	warnings:
		"scinit.c", line 314: warning: illegal pointer combination
		"scinit.c", line 316: warning: illegal pointer combination
		"scinit.c", line 318: warning: illegal pointer combination
	They may be ignored.

	During the compilation of scrt/objects.c, one will get the following
	warnings:
		"objects.c", line 605: warning: illegal pointer combination
		"objects.c", line 611: warning: illegal pointer combination
		"objects.c", line 614: warning: illegal pointer combination
		"objects.c", line 619: warning: illegal pointer combination
		"objects.c", line 622: warning: illegal pointer combination
	They may be ignored.

	
	For Microsoft Windows 3.1 with Microsoft C 7.0:

		No further steps are done on the workstation.  Follow the
		instructions in WIN16/README to transfer files to a PC and
		complete the build.

4.  Verify that the interpreter and compiler were correctly built:

	4 >cd test
	5 >../scrt/sci
	SCHEME->C -- ...
	> (load "test51.sc")
	MODULE form ignored
	TEST51
	"test51.sc"
	>  (test51 '())
	Hello world!
	#F
	> ^D
	6 >make test51
	../scsc/sccomp -schf ../scsc/sccomp.heap -C test51.sc
	test51.sc:
	../scsc/sccomp -schf ../scsc/sccomp.heap -c -g test51.c
	cc -o test51 -g test51.o ../scrt/libsc.a -lm
	7 >test51
	Hello world!

5.  Install the libraries, compiler, and interpreter in some directory
    such as ~/bin:

	8 >cd ..
	9 >make "DESTDIR = /udir/`whoami`/bin" install-private
	10 >rehash

    Given that this directory in the current search path, the compiler can
    now be accessed by "scc" and the interpreter by "sci".  

    N.B. Some users will see two or three sequences of error messages
    ending with "*** Error code 1 (ignored)."  These errors may be ignored.

6.  At this point, the source in cdecl and xlib can now be compiled if
    desired:

	11 > cd cdecl
	12 > make all
	13 > cd ../xlib
	14 > make all

    Documentation for cdecl and xlib is contained in files found in their
    respective directories.

7.  If desired, the embedded server sample program and library is
    constructed as follows:

	15 > cd ../server
	16 > make embedded libscsrv.a
